# Exercises

## Week 1

### Notes and Thoughts 3/03/2025
Writing in Github! what a shock. It's very new (to me), and not, entirely, what the platform is for (?) 
Regardless, that's what we'll be using it for, so I ought to make myself at home
I'm sure I've messed the annotation up immensely, and will be faced by some sort of incomprehensible abomination upon committing changes, but you live and you learn, right?

So, it turns out notation doesn't matter for .md files. I believe we were told that, but I've always been quite good at forgetting things. There's no spellcheck in here, which, as a child of the twenty-first century, feels somewhat akin to drawing on cave walls with a piece of charcoal. I'm aware how bad it would be for writing code (the ACTUAL purpose of this site) but, like, come on, man. Give me a break.

I intend to read and take some notes on the week 1 readings either tonight or within the next couple of days. I had trouble accessing the reading list at first, but it seems to be working now. 

## Week 3

### Responses to proposed questions

- My remix of Nick Monfort's 'Taroko Gorge' focuses primarily on the lives of dropouts and disappointments. It's quite different to the original work, which primarily appears as a celebration of the natural world and the beauty of it. More anthropocentric, mainly
- The poems are displayed in the same way, with randomly (to a degree) generated lines that scroll infinitely down the page.
- I'd say the remix is semi-successful. It does give off a certain vibe (pathetic, maybe?) but it seems less original than the initial poem, and might have less to say

### Poetry Experimentation

Lipograms (writing sans 'e')

I think that it is a truly horrid thing to do to work without such an important part of our mouth-sounds (which is for writing also, obviously) and so I will not do such a thing. 

Writing sans 'b'

This one should...ah. Well, I suppose there are some words that I have to avoid, which is okay, I can manage that. It's just  a small part, really, just one letter in our...yes, in our lexicon. I'm sure that there are many stories I could still make, working with what I have. It's a limit, of course it is, it puts a dampener on things. But if I try--oh. oops. 

Mesostic

I wonder if this sort of poeM

                     favouriTes? We can't know for sure, but 
                     
                            It has to appear on some of them, right?
                            
                            Can we all agree that each form needs to be loved?

(If formatting breaks for this poem I'll be mildly annoyed)

(it broke)

## Week 5

### Thinking about the upcoming proposals

Our proposals (the second round of presentations) are due near the start of May. I think I'd quite like to work in Inform for my final piece, but I'm not sure if the assignment allows that sort of deviation, as it isn't a platform we've worked on in class. Perhaps I'll ask. It's certainly the most engaged I've been in any of the mediums thus far. Inform is unlike any other coding language I've ever used, I'm enjoying it a lot.

I'm sure there's plenty of research I'll need to do to be able to work towards a completed piece, there's still a lot about Inform that I'm yet to learn. I have access to all of the basic documentation for beginners, so I don't foresee it being TOO too difficult to teach myself what I need to know. I imagine the piece itself will be relatively small, contained within a few rooms, with a high degree of interactivity, as that is what's most appealing to me in this specific medium.

I think planning with a flowchart is very helpful, plot-wise. I'm not yet sure if it'll be useful for the sort of object-based system that Inform uses, but there's still time to find out. I normally prefer to do the majority of my planning in my mind, with some dot-points scribbled into an open doc, but I doubt that'll be enough to take care of an interactive project like this. My memory might be good (or average, at best) but I don't trust myself to keep all those paths straight.
