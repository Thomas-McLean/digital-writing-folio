## Week 1

### Notes and Thoughts 3/03/2025
Writing in Github! what a shock. It's very new (to me), and not, entirely, what the platform is for (?) 
Regardless, that's what we'll be using it for, so I ought to make myself at home
I'm sure I've messed the annotation up immensely, and will be faced by some sort of incomprehensible abomination upon committing changes, but you live and you learn, right?

So, it turns out notation doesn't matter for .md files. I believe we were told that, but I've always been quite good at forgetting things. There's no spellcheck in here, which, as a child of the twenty-first century, feels somewhat akin to drawing on cave walls with a piece of charcoal. I'm aware how bad it would be for writing code (the ACTUAL purpose of this site) but, like, come on, man. Give me a break.

I intend to read and take some notes on the week 1 readings either tonight or within the next couple of days. I had trouble accessing the reading list at first, but it seems to be working now.
