# Exercises

## Week 1

### Notes and Thoughts 3/03/2025
Writing in Github! what a shock. It's very new (to me), and not, entirely, what the platform is for (?) 
Regardless, that's what we'll be using it for, so I ought to make myself at home
I'm sure I've messed the annotation up immensely, and will be faced by some sort of incomprehensible abomination upon committing changes, but you live and you learn, right?

So, it turns out notation doesn't matter for .md files. I believe we were told that, but I've always been quite good at forgetting things. There's no spellcheck in here, which, as a child of the twenty-first century, feels somewhat akin to drawing on cave walls with a piece of charcoal. I'm aware how bad it would be for writing code (the ACTUAL purpose of this site) but, like, come on, man. Give me a break.

I intend to read and take some notes on the week 1 readings either tonight or within the next couple of days. I had trouble accessing the reading list at first, but it seems to be working now. 

## Week 3

### Responses to proposed questions

- My remix of Nick Monfort's 'Taroko Gorge' focuses primarily on the lives of dropouts and disappointments. It's quite different to the original work, which primarily appears as a celebration of the natural world and the beauty of it. More anthropocentric, mainly
- The poems are displayed in the same way, with randomly (to a degree) generated lines that scroll infinitely down the page.
- I'd say the remix is semi-successful. It does give off a certain vibe (pathetic, maybe?) but it seems less original than the initial poem, and might have less to say

### Poetry Experimentation

Lipograms (writing sans 'e')

I think that it is a truly horrid thing to do to work without such an important part of our mouth-sounds (which is for writing also, obviously) and so I will not do such a thing. 

Writing sans 'b'

This one should...ah. Well, I suppose there are some words that I have to avoid, which is okay, I can manage that. It's just  a small part, really, just one letter in our...yes, in our lexicon. I'm sure that there are many stories I could still make, working with what I have. It's a limit, of course it is, it puts a dampener on things. But if I try--oh. oops. 

Mesostic

I wonder if this sort of poeM

                            It has to appear on some of them, right?
                            
                            Can we all agree that each form needs to be loved?

(If formatting breaks for this poem I'll be mildly annoyed)

## Week 5

### Thinking about the upcoming proposals

Our proposals (the second round of presentations) are due near the start of May. I think I'd quite like to work in Inform for my final piece, but I'm not sure if the assignment allows that sort of deviation, as it isn't a platform we've worked on in class. Perhaps I'll ask. It's certainly the most engaged I've been in any of the mediums thus far. Inform is unlike any other coding language I've ever used, I'm enjoying it a lot.

I'm sure there's plenty of research I'll need to do to be able to work towards a completed piece, there's still a lot about Inform that I'm yet to learn. I have access to all of the basic documentation for beginners, so I don't foresee it being TOO too difficult to teach myself what I need to know. I imagine the piece itself will be relatively small, contained within a few rooms, with a high degree of interactivity, as that is what's most appealing to me in this specific medium.

I think planning with a flowchart is very helpful, plot-wise. I'm not yet sure if it'll be useful for the sort of object-based system that Inform uses, but there's still time to find out. I normally prefer to do the majority of my planning in my mind, with some dot-points scribbled into an open doc, but I doubt that'll be enough to take care of an interactive project like this. My memory might be good (or average, at best) but I don't trust myself to keep all those paths straight. 

## Week 6

### Looking at past students' works

### Snow Season by Tanna Sulzberger

Snow season seems to be, from what I can tell, a relatively simple, linear work of digital writing. Sulzberger has built a digital poem, with different passages that flow on from each other following the clicking of certain highlighted words, and has chosen to explore themes of isolation, community, nature, and escape. The visuals of the piece are largely monochromatic, but the interactive words are pink, which makes them stand out more to the reader. I don't think this is the sort of work that I'd make, but I can appreciate it for what it is, and I enjoyed reading through it. Sometimes there's beauty in simplicity, you know. 

Looking at one of the works that a different group was looking at, House on the Hill by Lara J. Scuri, I found it to be quite interesting. Just this morning I was watching a video discussing the video game library of the Commodore 64 (a personal computer introduced in the 1980s) and there are many similarities between those games and the work that we see still being produced in works like House on the hill. This isn't limited to graphical similarities, the music, writing and the very soul of the games (forgive me for using such a nebulous concept) seem to have so much in common. Perhaps this speaks to a greater thread in the development of human self expression, the idea that we still have the capacity to make everything that we've made before, even if most would consider such works as primitive and outmoded. It's a distinct possibility that I'm being overly sentimental about this. Oh well, I think the style is cool, and I'm glad it's still around. Maybe that's all I have to say. 

## Week 8

### Reflection on my forthcoming folio piece

### Introduction
Directive is intended to be an interactive short story, using primarily traditional concepts of storytelling to tell a story about the dangers of industry monopoly and the threat that a lack of safety regulations can pose to everyday people. Using Inform 7, I hope to build a story that can show multiple different linearities, including an option for multiple different endings depending on the player's inputs. In its current iteration, Directive functions as a work of interactive literary fiction. The story will vary depending on what the reader choses to engage with, but if they are able to access and read all of the optional lore items, the story revolves around a pest control robot locked in a house, trying to escape after malfunctioning and killing (or severely injuring) the house's owner. As a worker in the company that makes these robots, you're faced with the moral dilemma of going against your employer and losing your job or helping them cover up the incident.

### Development

I hope that the reader's momentum will be driven by a curiosity about the (initially) vague backstory of the world that the story takes place in. By hiding clues to the true story of the game around the house, I intend to reward interaction with the smaller elements of the story, almost as if the reader is acting as a detective. Given that the piece revolves around a character that can be controlled, the interactive element of the platform should feel natural, a fusion between digital and literary platforms. I think from here I'll chose to pay closer attention to the story of the piece, as at the moment most of my attention has been focused towards the technical elements of the work. 

### Scope and Scale

Directive will be composed of seven main rooms and two extra rooms, with the extras existing outside of the bounds of the house and only to be used to deliver expository text. The total length of the work (including the non-printed text) will be about 4000 words, with roughly half of that available to the reader in-story. I don't imagine I'll run into any more tech issues from here (at least not any that won't be easily resolved) so I think my major focus from here on out will be finalising the story of the piece, and then, obviously, implementing that. 


##Story timeline

EVENTS BEFORE THE STORY
A company product (perhaps a sewing machine or a printer) breaks in a freak accident, harming the owner of the house that the story takes place in.
After pursuing legal action, the woman receives a hush-money bribe from the company, an old refurbished pest-control bot that would help her out around the house. 
Reluctantly, the woman accepts the bribe, admitting that she probably wasn’t going to do any better than that, anyway. 
For a while, all is well. The robot performs some menial tasks around the house, and the woman settles back into her regular life, living alone. 
One day, the woman’s cat brings a mouse into the home. During the robot’s refurbishment, its initial pest-control programming had become damaged and ignored, falling into disrepair. The robot reacts wildly to the mouse, charging and swinging its net like a weapon, and accidentally hits the woman upside the head, causing her to fall and hit her head, killing her instantly. The robot runs out of power following this event, and shuts down.
After the robot has absorbed enough sunlight to wake up and send an SOS, an agent of the company (not you) connects to the robot and learns what has happened. Choosing to protect the interests of the company, this agent hides the body under a blanket and walks the robot through to the storage room, the only place in the house that doesn’t see any sunlight.
Time passes. The woman’s cat still lives in the house, coming and leaving through the window in the bathroom. 
Moths eat a hole in the curtains of the storage room, exposing the robot to sunlight again. 
EVENTS OF THE STORY
You connect to the robot, oblivious to what has previously happened in the house. 
The robot moves through the house again, discovering the history of everything that has happened.
The cat runs away from you repeatedly, and you can choose to try and capture it in a box. If you capture it, you can take it with you so that it can live a better life.
Upon finding the body (which becomes available after you make a decision regarding the cat) the agent you play as realizes something is wrong. From here you can choose to either leave the house, (ignoring the story of the woman and taking the robot back to be repaired) search the robot’s memory to find details of what happened (only available if you’ve found all the lore dumps) or continue looking around the house.
There are four total endings: ignore woman (with cat) , ignore woman (without cat) , uncover the backstory (with cat) and uncover the backstory (without cat). Uncovering the backstory with the cat is the intended ending, but is also the hardest to achieve, and may not be possible on the first playthrough. 
Ultimately, this is a story about corporate overreach, “just doing your job”, and compassion.
